# Tableau-on-Geolocation

Basically this repository is a demo of my skills using Tableau. I have explored a data set of an office product retailer.  
I explore the performance of tech products versus furniture to see what value each of these categories is delivering by country.  
Exploration examines both the volume and profitability dimensions. Screenshots are included in this reporitory.
