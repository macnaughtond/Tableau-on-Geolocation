# Tableau-on-Geolocation

Summary to be completed.  

Basically this repository is a demo of my skills using Tableau. I have explored a data set of an office product retailer.  
I explore the performance of tech products versus furniture to see what value each of these categories is delivering by country.  
Exploration examines both the volume and profitability dimensions.
